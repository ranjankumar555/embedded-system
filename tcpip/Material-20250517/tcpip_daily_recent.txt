server: it is a process, executing under one device it will provide the service

client: it is also a process executing under a device it will request for the service.

host: host is a device/system it will work like server/client.






All the protocols are arranged in systamatic order is   called as reference model.
 2 types of reference model available 
 
     1.OSI reference model  [ open system interconnection ]
      +   7 layers are present
      +   theoritically implemented


   2. TCP reference model
     +  4 layers are present
     +   practically implemented








 
            Application layer -- > layer 7
            presentation layer -- > layer 6
            session layer  --> layer 5
            transport layer --> layer 4
            network layer  --> layer 3
           data link layer  --> layer 2
            physical layer --> layer 1

  reference purpose: please do not tell secreat password anyone
  
 please ---> physical layer
 do --> data link
 not --> network
 tell ---> transport
 secreat --> session
 password ---> presenattion
 anyone --> application 
 All these layers are bidirectional 







  
  Nature of connectivity: - is it connection oriented / connection less
   [ it is not wire/wireless ]

connection oriented:- Before transferring the data to destination,it will check the destination system avilable or not  [ TCP protocol it will support] f service available will forward or else ignore

   ex:   courier service 


connection less: Before transferring the data to destination,it will not  check the destination system avilable or not 
 [  it will support, UDP protocol]                 if service avaiable or not dont bother.just forward the data 

  ex: post-office 
  


    2. TCP reference model  [Transmission control protocol ]
        +  4 layers are present
        +  practically implemented

port number:
----------------
 The task of the transport protocol is to provide an end-to-end communication service
to applications residing on different hosts (or sometimes on the same host). In
order to do this, the transport layer requires a method of differentiating the applications
on a host. In TCP and UDP, this differentiation is provided by a 16-bit port  number.
 
 2 bytes: 0-65535 values can store in 2 bytes 

  use: once the data reached to the destination system,the data belongs to which process will be decided by port number.

 port numbers divided into 3 blocks
 
     0-1023 (well known/ services/ previliged ) 
                 Some well-known port numbers are permanently assigned to specific applications.
	the Internet Assigned Numbers  Authority (IANA, http://www.iana.org/) will control port numbers.
   
    SSH - 22                   FTP - 20 (DATA)
    HTTP-80                         - 21  (CMD)
    TELENT - 23
    TFTP -69                              HTTPS - 443 
    NTP - 123                             IMAP  - 143
       DHCP server -67
       DHCP CLIENT - 68                   
  
              
1024- 49151 (registered)
             IANA also records . ports, which are allocated to application developers on a   less stringent basis (which also means that an implementation doesn’t need to guarantee
the availability of these ports for their registered purpose). The range of IANA registered ports is 1024 to 49151


    49152-65535 (ephemeral    / short-lived / dynamic  / private/partial )
                   If an application doesn’t select a particular port (i.e., in sockets terminology, it
doesn’t bind() its socket to a particular port), then TCP and UDP assign a unique ephemeral port (i.e., short-lived) number to the socket.





 ip address must be unique


Q. by using which class can i create more host?
   Ans: using class A

Q. by using which class can i create more network's?
	Ans: using class C






 +   In a world ,there is no network with network address as  0      why becuase if all the network bits are zero then will get host address.


 + In a world,there is no network with the network address as 127      why becuase it is used for special purpose i.e loop back address

 loop back address: means the  system sending response to same system(itself)

+  In a world ,there is no host with all the host bits as zero     why becuase if all the host bits are zero then will get network address.

+ in a world ,there is no host with  all the host bits are one   why becuase it is used for broadcasting purose









 public ip:  public ip is used to connect with internet outside the world.which is provided by ISP provider
      public ip must be unique in entire world.

 private ip : private ip is used in LAN( local area network).
  which is provided by network administrator in the particular  orgnization
     In two different n/w's private ip may be same

IP conflict:   in one  n/w (same n/w) more than one device using same IP

private n/w :

class A:  10.0.0.0  to 10.255.255.255
claas B : 172.16.0.0   to 172.31.255.255
class C :  192.168.0.0  to 192.168.255.255
remainig all are public ip's






static ip: static ip address won't be change [ fixed ip]
dynamic ip: dynamic ip address will change [modified]











if one device needs to connect in n/w or needs to access internet means along with  IP address some other n/w configuration parameters are required (ex: subnet,gateway,DNS etc..)


 subnet: it is also called as default subnet mask /netmask value
          It is used to get the n/w address from the IP address.

     every class having fixed subnet mask values
      class A: 255.0.0.0
      class B: 255.255.0.0
      class C: 255.255.255.0


 class A:  1 n/w byte + 3 host bytes
        111 1111.0000 0000.0000 0000.0000 0000         
                    255.0.0.0

class B:  2 n/w bytes + 2 host bytes
              1111 1111.1111 1111.0000 0000.0000 0000
                 255.255.0.0

class C :  3 n/w bytes + 1host bye
            1111 1111.1111 1111.1111 1111.0000 0000
                   255.255.255.0

 lets' Assume ip address:   192.168.1.10    
  ---> 1100 0000.1010 1000.0000 0001.0000 1010
 ubnet mask: 255.255.255.0
        &  1111 1111.1111 1111.1111 1111.0000 0000

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 network address:      192.168.1.0 
          ----> 1100 0000.1010 1000.0000 0001.0000 0000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
  
 	




   Q:   is subnet mask value will get change?
  Ans:  yes ,it will get change when the network is divided into small subnetworks










Assignment:   if class B n/w is divided into 8 subnetworks then what is default subnet mask value?
                         if any packet recived to ip 172.12.35.6 then which subnetwork and 
                         which system will get the packet?






 proxy server:-
  ----------------
  Proxy server is an intermediary server between client and the internet. 
  A proxy server may reside on the user's local computer, or at any point
  between the user's computer and destination servers on the Internet.
 
 uses:-
      	1.Bandwidth savings and improved speeds
	2.Improved security:
	3.To control internet usage of employees 
	4.Privacy



DHCP-DORA Process
-----------------------
              client sends discover message to server

              discover:  please provide any one ip address to me those are having
                            capability to send ip. 
                         the message was broadcast ( those are waiting at port num 67 
                     will accept the request and remaining will ignore )


             server sends offer message as broadcast in n/w
               offer : in offer ,ip address,getway,subnet and other n/w configuration
                    parametrs are added and sent in n/w. (who will accept? ans: 
             those are waiting at port num 68 will accept and remaining will ignore

                      if offer , duration also available 
                  because dhcp server providing ip address based on contract poistion(lease)


             3. client sends request message as broadcast in n/w 
              request:  i am accepting ur offer letter whatever u mentioned in offer.
                 (who will recieve?  ans: those are waiting at port num 67 wil accept
          and remaining will ignore)
 
           4.   server sends ack message as broadcast in n/w 
                ack: ok fine ,i assigned ip address to u
                       u can use same ip address from now onwards 
           (who will accept? ans:  those are waiting at port num 68 will accept
                     and remaining will ignore)





  Topology is a method to connect the systems in a network.
 
1.bus topology
2.star topology
3.ring topology
4.mesh topology
5.hybrid topology





 bus topology
 ---------------
        All the devices are connected to a single  cable( techinically called as bus)

         +   adv: establishment cost is very less and easy to establish.
         + if a n/w is smaller then preferable this topology.

    dis: + transmission rate is very less ,why beacuse at a time one can recieve and
          can send.
         + this network should be closed circuit.
         + if more no.of systems are connected then complexity is more and finding the problem also difficult
         
         
star topology
-------------
        all the systems are connected to centralized hub.
         
+ speed of transmission is more
+ if system is not connected also no problem then remaining systems will communicate.
+ no need to provide closed circuit
+ need to take care that centralized hub should do functionality.
 


ring topology
-------------
   all the systems are connected in a n/w in the form of ring.
  
  + more reliable but hardware cost will increase.
  + need two LAN ports for each system 
  + esatblishment cost will increase
  + if one path is failed then it can send data from another path.

 
mesh topology
-------------
            all the systems are connected each other to other devices

    + more reliable but cost is more.
    + speed is more
    + so many direct and indirect paths available to send data to destination.

 hybrid topology
------------------
  combination of two or more topologies.






 connecting devices:
 ------------------------
      to connect the systems in a network or to connect multiple systems in a network then need to take the help of connecting devices.

           1.repeater
           2.hub
           3.switch
           4.bridge
           5.Router
           6.Gateway



 devices
-----------  
1.intelligent device
 + h/w and s/w invloved
 + it will take decision 
 + can read the n/w data

2. non intelligent device
  + only h/w part invloved
  + it cannot take decision  
  + it cannot read n/w data


Repeater
------------
   + it is not an intelligent device.
   + repeaters are used to increase the strength of the signal.(boostup the signal     strength)
   + used to extend the LAN n/w

   + it will amplifies the signal and will send .
   + it will not read the n/w data.      

    + A repeater is a device that operates only in the physical layer. Signals that carry information
within a network can travel a fixed distance before attenuation endangers the integrity of the data. A repeater receives a signal and, before it becomes too weak or corrupted, regenerates and retimes the original bit pattern. The repeater then sends the refreshed signal.


 hub
-------
+  it is called as multiport repeater
+ it is also non intellignet device
+ every message will be broadcast
 + it will send data to all the systems  why because it don't know whom to send and from whom the data comes.
+ traffic conjection will be more
+ data transmission rate is less.
 then whole network will be down.



Q: will it boostup the signal if required?
    Ans: yes,why because it is multiport repeater.





Switch
------------
   + switch is an intelligent device
   + switches are used to connect the systems with in a n/w
   + switch reads source physical address and decides from where the data is coming 
   + switch reads destination physical address and decides whom to send the data.
   + switch doesn't have permission to modify the data




physical address:

    +       it is used to find the physical existence of a system in a n/w
    +      any device in a n/w transferring the data to another device through physical media  then that device having  unique address called as physical address.

   + if the data transferring in a n/w it will travel through physical address but user no need to
        worry about the physical addess ,need to worry about the ip address only

   + the sizeof MAC address is 6 bytes.
   + each byte sepearted by : (in linux), - (in windows)
 
ex:               ___ : ___: ___:___: ___: ___
 
      first 3 bytes are manufacture addess
      remaining 3 bytes are device address.

  + each byte is represented in hexa decimal notation

           0-ff  0-ff 0-ff 0-ff 0-ff 0-ff
            --- : ---: ---:---:----:----



 ip address vs MAC address:

  +  ip address is used to get logical existance of a system in a n/w
      MAC address is used to get physical existance of a system  in a n/w
 
  + ip address divided into 2 versions : ipv4 and ipv6
    MAC address not divided

  + IPv4 size is 4 bytes
    MAC address size is 6 bytes

  + IPV4 represented in decimal string notation
    MAC address represented in Hexa decimal notation

 + IP address may change to a device
      MAC address is fixed to a device

 + IPv4 address sepearted by .
    MAC address sepearted by  :(in linux) , -(in windows)




 +   It is used to connect multiple n/w's
 + Router can be used in between two different n/w
              1.public - private
              2.public - public
              3.private - private      
 + If router is connected in between public and private n/w then public ip converted to private ip
   or private ip converted to public ip with the help of NAT [network address translation ] 
 
 + router not only reading the n/w data .if requires it will modify the n/w data.

 + routers are having capability to find the shortest path to the destination. for that RIP or OSPF protocols are configured .

 + router will do multitasking





PDU: the technical name for data in each layer is called as PDU
(protocol data unit)

PDU in TCP
--------------
Application layer    --- > data
Transport layer        ----> segment
Internet  layer         ----> datagram
network access layer  ---> frame

PDU in OSI
-------------
Application       ----> data
Presentation      ----> data
session             -----> data 
transport           ----> segment
n/w layer        ----> packet
data link layer   ---> frame
physical layer  ---> bits





TCP vs UDP
---------------
1. TCP means transmission control protocol
      UDP means User datagram protocol

2. TCP works in transport layer
    UDP also works in transport layer

3. TCP is connection oriented service.
   connection oriented:  before sending the segment,it will check the destination system available or not. if available it will forward the  segment or else it will drop the segment.

   UDP is connection less service
         connection less: before sending the  segment,it won't bother about the destination system.  if the destination available or not avialble it will forward the segment.


4. TCP is reliable communication.
            [ack..is available]
   UDP is unreliable communication
             [ No ack]

5. data guarantee available in TCP
    Data guarantee not avaibale in UDP

6. TCP maintains sequence numbers.
     UDP doesn't maintain sequence numbers.

7. TCP header size 20-60 bytes
     UDP header size is 8 bytes

8. TCP is complex protocol
    UDP is simplest protocol

9. TCP for connection establishment, it will follow 3-way handshaking method
    TCP for connection terminating ,it will follow 4 way handshaking method
    TCP for transmitting segment,it will follow sliding window mechanism 

   UDP will not follow such mechanism's

10. TCP retransmit the data ,if not reached to destination
       UDP not follow

11. TCP follows stream oriented service
      UDP follows datagram service.
